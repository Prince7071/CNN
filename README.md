# Digits Recognition Neural Network

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Classifies digits (0-9) from 28x28 grayscale images
- Built using CNN architecture
- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Can predict on test data and custom images
- Saves and loads trained models

## How to Run

1. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook digits_recognition.ipynb
```
3. To predict a custom image:
• Add your image (28x28 grayscale) in the test_images folder
• Run the prediction cell in the notebook
